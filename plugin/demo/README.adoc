This folder is a Godot project that you can directly open in Godot 4.2 to see an implementation of the plugin in a real Godot game.

IMPORTANT: To use this project, you have to uncompress the contents of the `addons.zip` file in the link:https://github.com/Iakobs/godot-play-game-services/releases[releases section] of the repository to the root folder of the project.

== Directory Structure
The demo project contains a `scenes` folder with all the `.tscn` and `.gd` files that you will need, everything is inside this folder.

You have sub folders for every feature of the plugin, e.g. `achievements` for displaying the achievements of the game or `snapshots` for the save/load game functionalities.

== Signing In
The first thing the project does is checking if the user is authenticated, and if not, calls the `sign_in` method of the plugin.

.MainMenu.gd
[source,gdscript]
----
func _ready() -> void:
	SignInClient.user_authenticated.connect(func(is_authenticated: bool): ## <1>
		if not is_authenticated:
			SignInClient.sign_in()
	)
    ## ... more code ...
----

<1> The plugin itself calls the `initialize()` method when creating the Autoloads, which checks if the user is authenticated and emits the `user_authenticated` signal, that's why the project subscribes to it.

If the user is successfully signed in, you will see the Sign In animation displayed on top of the screen:

image::screenshots/main_menu/main_menu.png[alt=Screenshot of the main menu with the Signed in animation displayed on top,title=Main Menu showing a user logged in.,width=298]

== Achievements
The achievements button will open the achievements screen:

image::screenshots/achievements/achievements_screen.png[alt=Screenshot of the achievements screen,title=The achievements screen.,width=298]

There you will see a `Show Achievements` button and a scrollable list of the achievements of the game. Depending on the type of the achievement, you will see another button underneath every achievement to reveal, unlock or increment the achievement.

The `Show Achievements` button opens a new window provided by Google with the list of achievements for the game, but you can only click on them to see a detailed description.

image::screenshots/achievements/show_achievements.png[alt=Screenshot of the screen provided by google, with a list of achievements,title=The achievements screen provided by google.,width=298]

Closing that window by swiping it down, you will be back at the achievements menu. The loading of the achievements inside the scrollable section, happens in the `Achievements.gd` script.

.Achievements.gd
[source,gdscript]
----
func _ready() -> void:
	if _achievements_cache.is_empty():
		AchievementsClient.load_achievements(true) ## // <1>
	AchievementsClient.achievements_loaded.connect( ## // <2>
		func cache_and_display(achievements: Array[AchievementsClient.Achievement]):
			_achievements_cache = achievements
			if not _achievements_cache.is_empty() and achievement_displays.get_child_count() == 0:
				for achievement: AchievementsClient.Achievement in _achievements_cache: ## // <3>
					var container := _achievement_display.instantiate() as Control
					container.achievement = achievement
					achievement_displays.add_child(container)
	)
    ## ... more code ...
----
<1> If the cache is empty, we call the `load_achievements` method of the plugin.
<2> We subscribe to the `achievemets_loaded` signal to receive the achievements.
<3> For every achievement, we instantiate an `AchievementDisplay.tscn` file and we feed it the achievement. Then, we add the control as a child of the scrollable section.
